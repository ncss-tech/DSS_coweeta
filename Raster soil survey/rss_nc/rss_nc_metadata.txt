  Description:
    Abstract:
      This georeferenced soil database is a representation of soil survey work 
      completed using digital soil mapping methodologies. Where available, 
      this data represents the most detailed level of soil geographic data 
      developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The associated data 
      represents Raster Soil Survey class data, available in the State of North Carolina. 

      The spatial data rendered in the geodatabase result from Raster Soil Survey - 
      Project Mapping. Raster Soil Survey is a reference to products of soil survey 
      work completed using digital soil mapping methodologies. 

      A 10 meter file geodatabase raster layer aligns with the Gridded 
      Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) Database. Raster Soil Survey data represents 
      the most detailed soil survey information for a given area within the Gridded 
      National Soil Geographic Database (gNATSGO) product. Each cell is assigned a 
      value corresponding to a single attribute 'MUKEY' in the raster attribute table 
      to facilitate joins with soil attribute data. Additional information on methods 
      and standards for Digital Soil Mapping and Raster Soil Survey can be found in 
      Chapter 5 of the Soil Survey Manual and Part 648 of the National Soil Survey 
      Handbook.
    Purpose:       
      The Raster Soil Survey was created for use in resource planning and analysis 
      of soils data. The Raster Soil Survey depicts the understanding of soil spatial 
      variability and the distribution of soil properties and classes beyond 
      traditional constraints of scale and order in SSURGO. The Raster Soil Survey map
      and associated data were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National 
      Cooperative Soil Survey.

  Use_Constraints:

    The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation
    Service, should be acknowledged as the data source in products
    derived from these data. 

    This soil survey product does not contain detailed site-specific 
    information and is not designed for use as a primary regulatory 
    tool in site-specific permitting decisions. Soil Survey Information
    is public information and may be interpreted by organizations, agencies,
    units of government, or others based on their own needs; however, 
    users are responsible for the appropriate application of soil survey
    information. NRCS will not accept reassignment of authority for 
    decisions made by other Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies. 
    NRCS will not make changes to Official Soil Survey Information or of
    any supplemental soil mapping for purposes related solely to State 
    or local regulatory programs.

    Digital data files are periodically updated and amended. Files are 
    dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version 
    of the data.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The attribution is confirmed by display of the map data using
      the geospatial and tabular software, in review selected attributes 
      and spatial relationships. All attribute data conform to the attribute
      codes in the Raster Soil Survey Project correlation document.

  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The accuracy of these digital data is based upon the sourced digital 
        environmental data references outlined in the Raster Soil Survey Project
        correlation. Positional accuracy is referenced as spatial tolerance 
        for the project accuracy assessment outlined in the Raster Soil Survey
        Project correlation document accessed at the online refences cited in
        the lineage.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Descriptive attributes (tabular information about the raster) were developed 
    specifically for the Raster Soil Survey Projects referenced in this Raster
    Soil Survey Area. The classes or Map Units defining the soil survey area
    are distributed seamlessly across natural landforms over a broad
    physiographic area, or provide detailed soil information in areas without
    digital soil survey data in SSURGO as part of progressive soil survey.
  Completeness_Report:
    Completeness of maps across the area of interest was assured. 
    A Raster Soil Map Unit is spatially represented by a 10 meter cell 
    assigned to a class (Soil Map Unit). A Soil Map Unit 
    is composed of the entire population of soil components found within.

      Process_Description:
        This dataset consists of georeferenced digital map data 
        and computerized attribute data. The National Soil Information 
        System (NASIS) database was developed by NRCS soil scientists 
        according to national standards. The Raster Soil Survey Map Units 
        are linked to attributes in NASIS. A statewide file geodatabase (ESRI) 
        was created using ArcGIS software to accommodate the spatial 
        and tabular Raster Soil Survey data. Spatial and tabular data is packaged 
        in a standard product consistent with the delivery of USDA-NRCS Gridded 
        Soil Survey Geographic Database (gSSURGO). All structural 
        and attribute metadata for SSURGO also applies 
        to Raster Soil Survey data. gSSURGO is similar to 
        the standard USDA-NRCS SSURGO Database product but 
        in the format of an Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc.
        (ESRI®) file geodatabase.

    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Relevant attributes are the cell soil values. Raster cell locations are 
      representative of Map Units developed from soil survey projects completed 
      using digital soil mapping methodologies. Field investigations were conducted 
      to infer the relationships between observed soil descriptions and spatially
      explicit environmental data. The Map Unit key (MUKEY) is used to link to information 
      in the National Soil Information System (NASIS) tables.
