November 2021 RSS database

Raster Soil Survey (RSS) is a reference to products of soil survey work completed using digital soil mapping methodologies in the format of an Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI®) file geodatabase raster. This is similar in format to the USDA-NRCS Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) Database and Gridded National Soil Geographic Database (gNATSGO). Where RSS data is available, it represents the most detailed soil survey information for a given area within gNATSGO. A file geodatabase raster has the capacity to store much more data and thus greater spatial extents and finer spatial resolution than the traditional Soil Geographic Database (SSURGO) product. All spatial data are stored within the geodatabase instead of externally. RSS, gNATSGO, SSURGO and gSSURGO are considered products of the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) partnership. Compressed files for user download completed with WinZip v23.0 (Build 13300).

RSS products have parallel functionality to gSSURGO.  For more information about gSSURGO including user guides, ArcTools and citation information, visit the NRCS gSSURGO web page at: https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/home/?cid=nrcs142p2_053628
